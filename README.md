<h1>Medibox Simulation - EN2853 Embedded Systems</h1>
 <p>Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Medibox Simulation project, an individual exercise for the EN2853 Embedded Systems and Applications course. This project aims to create a fully-functioning simulation of a Medibox using an ESP32 microcontroller on the Wokwi platform. The simulation includes the following key functionalities:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Setting time zone and fetching current time from the NTP server</li>
        <li>Setting and managing 3 alarms</li>
        <li>Ringing alarms with proper indications and stopping them using a push button</li>
        <li>Disabling all alarms</li>
        <li>Monitoring temperature and humidity levels with warnings for unhealthy conditions</li>
    </ul>
<p>This repository contains the code and resources for the project, organized in a clear and structured manner. The assignment is worth 30% of the final grade, and the marking criteria include fetching the current time, menu navigation, alarm management, proper indications, disabling alarms, and monitoring environmental conditions. Creativity and neatness are also considered in the evaluation.</p>
